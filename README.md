# Machine Learning Foundations

In this repository I collect all the completed assignements of the course "Machine Learning" given by Andrew NG through Coursera.
All the functions have been written by myself in Matlab by following the instructions given for each exercise and after the learning sections.

You can find here functions about:

1. LINEAR REGRESSION
- plotData.m - Function to display the dataset
- computeCost.m - Function to compute the cost of linear regression 
- gradientDescent.m - Function to run gradient descent
- computeCostMulti.m - Cost function for multiple variables
- gradientDescentMulti.m - Gradient descent for multiple variables
- featureNormalize.m - Function to normalize features
- normalEqn.m - Function to compute the normal equation

2. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
- plotData.m - Function to plot 2D classification data
- sigmoid.m - Sigmoid Function
- costFunction.m - Logistic Regression Cost Function
- predict.m - Logistic Regression Prediction Function
- costFunctionReg.m - Regularized Logistic Regression Cost
